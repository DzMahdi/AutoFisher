# AutoFisher
This is an autofishing script that uses PyAutoGUI and OpenCV. It automatically fishes for the user by taking screenshots, searching for a fish image using OpenCV, and clicking on it. PyAutoGUI is used for screenshots and clicks, and OpenCV for image processing. The script runs until the user stops it. This automation saves users time and effort.
