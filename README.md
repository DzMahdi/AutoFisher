## How It Works

1. **Image Detection**: AutoFisher uses the power of OpenCV to continuously monitor a specified area of your game screen.
2. **Automatic Click**: When the program detects the fishing cue (the yellow line on the blue square), it simulates a mouse click, casting your fishing line.
3. **Fish Reeling**: Once a fish bites, AutoFisher automatically presses the "e" key to reel in your catch.
4. **Continuous Operation**: The program will keep fishing until you decide to stop. Simply press the "q" key to end the session.

## Getting Started

1. **Dependencies**: Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
   - OpenCV: For image processing.
   - pyautogui: To simulate mouse clicks and key presses.
   - keyboard: For key detection.

2. **Reference Image**: Load the provided reference image that corresponds to the fishing cue in the game.

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script and let AutoFisher do its magic. After a brief 3-second delay, it will start monitoring the game screen for the fishing cue.

4. **End Session**: To stop the program, simply press the "q" key. The total number of fish caught will be displayed.

## Enhance Your Gaming

With AutoFisher, you can focus on other aspects of the game or simply relax while the program efficiently fishes for you. Try it out and elevate your Project Slayers experience!
