# Introducing AutoFisher, 

the ultimate solution for automating fishing in your favorite game! If you've ever found yourself endlessly clicking away at your mouse while trying to catch a fish, this code is for you. With AutoFisher, you can sit back and relax while the program does the work for you.

The code is easy to use and requires only a few libraries, including OpenCV for image processing, pyautogui for click-and-key simulation, and keyboard for key detection. Once you've loaded the reference image that corresponds to the yellow line on the blue square, the program takes a screenshot of the specified play area and uses advanced image processing techniques to detect the presence of the yellow line. If the line is present, the program simulates a click on the fishing button, saving you the time and effort of clicking yourself.

But that's not all - AutoFisher also detects when a fish has been caught and automatically presses the "e" key on your keyboard to reel it in. And the best part? The program runs until you manually stop it by pressing the "q" button.

Say goodbye to endless clicking and hello to efficient, automated fishing with AutoFisher. Try it out today and see how it can enhance your gaming experience.
